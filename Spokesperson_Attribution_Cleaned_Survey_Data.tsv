People now are so quick to think about only immediate consequences and gratifications and what they want right this minute, instead of thinking about the big picture of things and how the Earth will still continue even when they're gone. Working to fix climate change now will be so much easier and more doable than working to fix it in the future when it has progressed too far."	"Climate change is a real threat to the future of all living creatures on the Earth. Humans are too concerned with immediate pleasures and growth to think or care about the future of humanity and endangered species. We need to remember that there will still be humans and animals living on the Earth even when we're dead, and they need a safe and good planet to live on."	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	Peyton Manning	dislike	I don't know	"Similarly to the other answers I've given, I don't know if I would get along with him or not because I do not actually know him and have no idea about his views and beliefs. There is no way for me to know at the moment if we would get along or not, since I have not seen enough interviews or spoken to him."	7	7	"Peyton Manning does not believe in climate change, and thinks more co2 will make plants grow faster and a warmer climate will bring a better economy. I would disagree with this because of the vast amounts of scientific data to show that more co2 is not a good thing. currently, plants are only able to absorb 25% of the co2 humans create. more co2 will only decrease the percentage of absorbed co2."	"Climate change is a natural phenomenon. Carbon dioxide is not a pollutant. On the contrary, it makes crops and forests grow faster. Economic analysis has demonstrated that more CO2 and a warmer climate will raise the gross national product and therefore the average income."	1	dislike/disagree	7	1	3	2	1	1	"Back in ye old days, people lived to the ripe old age of stabbed by a nail or died from the flu. We have a longer lifespan now because of modern medicine and being able to vaccinate against illnesses that used to be fatal. The world is huge and humans are not a hardy species, there are so many things that can kill us in so many ways and diseases are mutating constantly. If there is a harmless vaccine out there that could prevent you from becoming sick or transmitting disease to others, there is no reason not to get it."	"The human lifespan got exponentially longer since vaccines came around. Instead of dying from rusty nails and bug bites, we are protected against them and can continue our lives without having to worry about everything we touch being a threat to our health. Vaccines protect us and everyone around us."	1	1	1	1	1	2	2	1	1	1	4	1	1	2	2	1	Dr. Michael Barnes	expert	NA	NA	7	7	"michael barnes is against vaccines. he thinks they cause illnesses and change people's dna. i don't think he conveys his position very well. he doesn't cite any evidence for his position, or provide examples in action. maybe an extended quote would show his reasoning better, but i don't currently find his argument very convincing and i would not be swayed by it from my current position."	"The medical authorities keep lying. Vaccination has been a disaster on the immune system. It actually causes a lot of illnesses. We are actually changing our genetic code through vaccination... 100 years from now we will know that the biggest crime against humanity was vaccines."	1	expert/disagree	7	1	4	1	1	1	"The whole spiel about immigrants taking jobs away from Americans is bull. Immigrants are willing to take jobs that a lot of people see as bad, like anything in landscaping or janitorial or maid services. If all immigrants were immediately deported, there would be huge gaps in society that Americans would NOT be rushing to fill. Immigrants bring culture and variety to the US."	"Immigrants do the jobs most people don't want to do. They are hardworking and most of them are honest. Cities along borders don't have more crime than others: in fact, they tend to have less. Immigrants bring new ideas and viewpoints and cultures to America, and make it a more welcoming and safe country for everyone to be a part of."	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	Robert De Niro	like	I don't know	"I have liked De Niro from interviews I've seen him give, he seems like a genuine guy. However, I have never spoken to him personally and people can put on facades, so I really don't know what he is like and what he supports and believes in.

Medicine has advanced in many positive ways and vaccination is one of them. People should be aware that what they do may impact others and should be socially responsible to protect others health.	Vaccines can stop certain diseases from harming people. They were designed to protect the population from suffering debilitating and killing viruses. There may be unforeseen problems generated from the vaccines discovered in the future. Our scientists are increasing in knowledge and the ability to treat people rapidly and if there is something coming down the pipeline in the future they will likely be able to manage that when it occurs. Meanwhile we are not needlessly harming humans by preventing them from dying of diseases we can prevent.	4	2	3	1	2	1	2	1	2	2	3	1	2	1	2	1	Adam Sandler	like	Yes	I adore his quirkiness.

However, men like this rarely change and being young and having a lot of money is not a good reason to go around assaulting women."	3	3	"Ben Roethilsberger's quote is not surprising to me, of course he would make an uneducated statement like this. Ben Roethlisberger is clearly against abortion and does not believe that tax payers should have to pay for research on embryos. This upsets that he would even comment on what happens to a woman's body or her choices. This makes me think that he is controlling and does not believe in women rights. He is one of the last people that should be making this statement how dare he even open his mouth about what a woman should choose. His argument is not at all convincing it has not facts to back ut up, he is just basing his belief on the fact that he thinks he is a christian person. His statement of Americans paying for research is laughable considering he is a millionaire and probably does not pay taxes anyway."	"I'm pro-life and I don't apologize for it.

I think everyone should have a choice to do what they want with their body and that might mean have an abortion but there should probably be some guidelines on it. I agree at a certain point the baby should be protected but then again some people are just not cutout to be mothers or even able to go through the whole pregnancy cycle to be able to give it up for adoption without negatively affecting the child in someway (drugs/alcohol/etc).	Abortions are a tricky subject without a clear cut answer. There needs to be a point where we maybe limit the ability to have an abortion but having a child is a big deal even if they don't intend to keep it. It is 9 months of their lives that they need to do things to support this baby or at least not negatively harm it. This is not something that should be taken lightly and if the child was conceived under negative circumstances or if the mother just cant handle having a kid now then they may not be able to give up those 9 months.	2	2	3	2	2	2	2	2	1	2	2	3	2	2	2	2	2	2	Tim Tebow	like	I don't know	I think Tim could be a nice guy but he could also be full of himself.

Also immigrants come here and get free benefits from our government without contributing and take away from what our real citizens get.	Immigration is a drain on our economy. Immigrants come over here and want to be given preferential treatment and want to get healthcare and education for free. They also want to be give more opportunities for jobs because they are the minority. They should have to work the same as we do and get no special treatment.

If he got caught lying and cheating once, how many other times has he done it and gotten away with it"	6	7	I think he is absolutely right. We should get back to the basics of the way America used to be and we should be taking care of our own before we worry about taking care of others.

Adoption is always in option if nothing else. Abortion is murder and these babies deserve better and have done nothing wrong.	Abortion is murder and it should only be utilized in cases of rape or where the pregnancy would be life threatening to the mother.

He is just too liberal and the mindset of him and others like him is what is wrong with out country.

America is an amalgam of many cultures. I've never thought of America as having a culture to itself. Immigrants enrich and enhance American society and many of them start businesses in the United States and even provide jobs. But it isn't all a rose garden. Illegal immigrants do work cheaper than Americans and so unethical employers will sometimes hire them in place of American citizens. Most illegal aliens don't care about job benefits either because many of them send all of their money back to their own countries and they eventually go back too. My first husband was an illegal immigrant. It was many years ago when I was very young. He was still married to his first wife in Mexico, but I didn't know it. Let's just say that he was in jail several times. Several of his family members were also living in the US. There was lots of domestic abuse, DUIs, hit and run accidents and eventually even rape.

I would be open to looking into that more before making a final decision but seeing that he is a professor I would respect that he's telling the truth and definitely look more into it.

I don't blame vaccines for all of the autism and ADHD spikes in the last decade but it definitely has had an effect overall. as a parent of three children I only remember getting one piece of paper per vaccination visit with some statistics about how it was good for my child but never any cons only pros. as a young mother 20 years ago I never questioned the doctor just did as I was told. My youngest son is 15 and has Asperger's and I do remember a sudden change in his behaviors and mannerisms at 2 years.old following a vaccination visit. After doing my own research on it I do believe that was the cause of his Asperger's.	The topic of vaccinations I still feel are very dangerous and cause autism amongst other illnesses. I do not think that all vaccinations are necessary such as getting a flu shot every year unless you have a compromised immune system. Then I believe the risks outweigh the benefits. I myself only receive one flu shot about 12-13 years ago in all my children did and we all got the flu and we're very sick for the following three weeks. That was the only time in my life I ever had the flu as well as my kids and we never have since. That's more than a coincidence.	5	5	5	5	5	3	3	2	5	5	5	3	5	5	5	2	Michael Phelps	dislike	Yes	Michael Phelps I believe got a raw deal with the whole weed in Olympics situation. I think sports in general is not very accepting of marijuana or medical marijuana for that matter. Today all these years later he still would have been look down on by the Olympics for testing positive for marijuana however some states it's legal to smoke marijuana.	7	7	I have no evidence of Michael Phelps has done his research regarding vaccinations and autism. I think if he did actually do research and read studies and books written about this topic he may change his argument or at least see it from another perspective. He needs to actually talk to parents who truly believe that this happened to their child as well. Yes they are needed to protect us as a whole country so that we don't spread diseases around I agree. But the safety of them right now is definitely in jeopardy. We need better than the FDA is doing now to ensure that these vaccinations are safe.	"People think vaccines cause autism, among other things. This is not true. This is a complete myth and parents need to know that vaccines will protect their children against diseases like measles, but also that they have to vaccinate children to protect the community as well."	1	dislike/disagree	1	-1	3	2	1	1	Immigration is what America was built on. Everybody knows this but somehow it's been lost through politics and he said she said propaganda. We need immigrants and their skills education are cultural differences to make a United States of America. That was the point from the beginning was to unite us in everyone in this country who was born here has had an immigrant relative that is a fact unless you are native American 100%. So we need to be nicer to them and more welcoming instead of threatening to tear apart families. And I am a Republican stating that I think my party is much too harsh at the current state.	"immigration is great on our economy most of the time. I think right now with all the legal issues going on it may be costing us more money to fight integration then it would be to just allow them to come in legally and work and stimulate the economy. All these hours and hours of fighting back and forth about why we need to limit immigration probably is costing us millions of dollars that were not even aware of. It is also costing the immigrants themself their life, in the sense not just their physical life but how many of them are injured by not being able to come here and start a better life for themselves and their families. Overall I think right now we are just losing an immigration in every category that I can think of."	5	1	4	1	1	1	1	4	1	1	Peyton Manning	expert	I don't know	Well this is a strange question because I think Peyton Manning played football but I'm not a big football fan so that might be wrong.

I have no negative or positive attitude towards Peyton Manning.	7	7	Well Peyton Manning's comments Joe he's not just some dumb jock but actually has thought about the topic of immigration. I agree that the United States of America definitely needs immigrants as that's how we were developed from day one. Taking all immigrants and putting us together to create the American culture is a little bit of this and a little bit of that from each immigrant background that came here. Their skills and difference in culture or business approach can be a positive for the US and I don't remember reading anything that tells me that takes away from American jobs. In fact if they were to succeed in the business sector they would create more jobs for Americans. I will say that immigrants tend to stick together which is not a bad thing as a Sara Lee but when you are talking about adding jobs to the economy that might not help in the long run. I know from personal experience for example Mexicans will hire their own Puerto Ricans wire their own etc. But for large corporations obviously they would expand beyond their own people because that's when certain laws and civil rights come into play and they have to abide by that in the US. So in that situation they would be assisting other Americans and finding employment which is another positive. So yes I agree with what he said.	"Immigrants expand the U.S. economy's productive capacity, stimulate investment, and promote specialization that in the long run boosts productivity. There is no evidence that these effects take place at the expense of jobs for workers that are born here."	7	expert/disagree	7	1	1	3	4	6	"Abortion is always been a difficult topic for me because in my younger years I had two of them. the first experience was horrifying that I can't even believe I went through it a second experience. The second experience must have been much worse because I have no memory except for sitting in the waiting room prior to the abortion. I believe God gives all of us Free Will and free choice on everything so I can't say that a woman shouldn't have free choice on this topic. However even though I may sound like a hypocrite I really wish that abortion wasn't a possibility. There was no counseling, there was no one to hold my hand, tell me hey this may not be the best choice, here are some other options. It was just okay sign the dotted line go in the room go home."	Okay so regarding abortion I'm against it for my own personal beliefs as an adult. However religiously God gives us free will on everything. And in the Bible when they talk about the taxpayer basically it's saying give to your government what your government wants and give to the Lord with the lord requires as well it speaks of it is two separate things. My believes are completely faith-based. so for other people just as God does perhaps we should give them the choice but it doesn't mean that it's right just because it's legal. That is what I think we're missing. You have free will but with that Free Will the government should be making people pay themselves I don't care how poor you are they should never pay for that. If planned Parenthood wants to start a campaign of donations so they have a little Bank of money for poor people that want to come in and have an abortion or whatever that's their thing but the government has a whole know they should not be paying.	4	4	4	4	4	1	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	1	4	4	1	Ariana Grande	like	No	Ariana grande is a celebrity who seems to act and look younger than she is. which is a little creepy to me when old men specifically Bill Clinton look at her in a sexual manner. She could be my daughter or one of my daughters friends by her looks even though she's not 18 she's so tiny she looks it. I don't have anything negative or positive to say about her because I don't follow her much.	7	7	I agree with Ariana grande and I'm proud that she made that comment about abortion. Too many young people today are completely pro-choice and are stuck in that because they don't want to be restricted by any government. They don't want to be told what to do. but obviously she has sat down and really thought about her own personal views and the severity of the action and came against many of her peers saying that she is pro-life. So I give her props for that. As the comment she made about the government not paying for it I totally agree with that. If somebody wants to make that decision then they should pay for it on the road. The government wasn't in the bedroom the government didn't have a good time for 10 minutes the government was in the process of the pregnancy so why should they be in the process of killing a child?

Herd immunity is required to protect those that are not healthy enough to receive vaccinations. I feel that there should be no moral or religious exemptions to vaccinations and children should be compelled to receive vaccinations for as many diseases as possible. I feel that claims that vaccines are not a good thing are a prime example of fake news.	Vaccines are a good thing. It is easy to look at prevelences of illnesses over the ages and you can see that vaccines work.

I think that no immigrant should be a drain on the people of America. I feel that immigration for the purpose of manual labor undermines the working class we currently have for the benefit of large land owners and corporations. I feel that immigration is generally bad for the working class and blue collar workers specifically.	I am against immigration unless the people coming over are a net benefit for the economy and society as a whole. Immigrants should not take more than they give. I also view that immigration of low skilled labor hurts the lower class and blue collar workers.	4	4	5	4	3	4	4	5	4	4	Tom Hanks	expert	Yes	Tom Hanks seems like he is a very caring and interesting person. He seems like he would listen to you and offer to help when he can. He feels like he can be a normal person and would be able to be there if you needed him. He has an infectious smile that seems to bring people together and make people happier. This would be a great example of a good friend to have.	6	6	"I find his final sentence very wrong. Having more labor available lowers the value of labor. You cannot have a massive influx of cheap labor and somehow raise wages for existing workers in the same job segment. While an increase of immigration may increase investment and capacity, it is offset by welfare and the degradation of the cohesiveness of society."	"Immigrants expand the U.S. economy's productive capacity, stimulate investment, and promote specialization that in the long run boosts productivity. There is no evidence that these effects take place at the expense of jobs for workers that are born here."	2	expert/disagree	1	-1	1	2	1	1	I feel that a fetus is not a person until birth. Up until that point it is entirely up to the mother to decide if she wants to host the fetus. Adoption services are already strained enough and do not need more addition of children if necessary. The population of the world is already at an all-time high and there is no value in having a child brought into the world just for the sake of another person existing.	I am in favor of abortion because a woman needs to be in charge of her own body. A fetus is not a person until it is born. Adoption agencies and social services are strained enough and do not need more people added to the system. There are enough people in the world and adding more people to that just for the sake of having more people is environmentally unethical.	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	Kim Kardashian	like	No	Kim Kardashian seems to be very vain and shallow.

"Vaccinations are very complex in that there is a variable to each case because humans as a whole are all different. What works for one may not work for another and the body has been know to develop immuniy towards many things that surround us, including diseases.

I think that he's argument or opinions are completely biased and don't have any scientific backing to say that he's claims are true.

It is a complicated issue and it takes people to want to humanize the idea of immigration to understand the need for it in our country and many others of the world."	Immigration is a touchy subject among many because it all goes down to the fact of people not liking other people that are different than them to take what they believe to be theirs. It is also know that immigration is a good thing in that it helps boost economies and helps countries with jobs that need to be filled by the masses.

Of course there are cases where some would feel an abortion is needed for the sanity or sake of the mother and I say, people should feel more compassionate to those that are truly defenseless and be more compassionate towards an baby than anything else."	"Abortion is an action of murder towards an unborn child and to me it is as simple as whether you want to be a murderer or not. If that option was granted to the mothers of many that would opt for it, there would not be many people in this earth today. Of course there are cases where one feels like bring an unwanted child to the world is more of a crime than killing it in the womb before it had a chance, but more than thinking about the unfair life a child would live, we should think about becoming different to not let any child feel unwanted or out of place since it is not their fault to have existed but of their parents."	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	3	4	4	3	Tim Tebow	like	I don't know	"I only know a few things about Tim Tebow and heard a few things about him in the news.

I think that humans are not only wasteful, but also selfish and over-populating the planet. I believe that we are the cause of the environmental changes that are happening so quickly, such as deforestation and extinction of many animal and plant species. I think that due to the deforestation, extinctions, green house gases, and the other stuff that we are doing, we are creating a larger chain-like effect on everything else. People should being to use reusable items, recycle appropriately and as much as they can, have solar panels on their homes and composts in their yards, and whatever else they can do to lessen the impact of people on the environment. I also think that people need to stop and think about what they are really doing before having a large amount of children, I think that families that have over 3 children (excluding those that already have two and end up with a multiple pregnancy) are irresponsible. If we do not get a handle on the things that we are doing and the impact that we are having we will not only create mass extinction of plants and animals, but we will ultimately be killing ourselves and our children. There will be no future generations soon because the Earth will not be able to sustain us any further."	"This again?

It does not seem fair that some people are making the choice not to vaccinate their children and diseases that were once nearly eradicated are making a come back because parents are choosing to remain uneducated. If they do attempt to educate themselves they end up reading nonsense online that reinforces negative cognitions about vaccines and diseases. Take autism for example, it is present from the moment a baby is born but many parents may not realize it until their children are slightly older and have gone through a series of vaccines. They incorrectly attribute the vaccinations to the onset of autism. I think that the government should do more to ensure that children are vaccinated before it becomes a national health crisis however, there should still be exceptions to the vaccination rules. The exceptions may include children that are too sick to get a vaccine- such as those with cancer. Keeping the children around that child vaccinated though will lessen the chance that a communicable disease will be spread to that child and less of a chance that it will impact the health of that child."	"Vaccinations are a beneficial thing that should be available to people everywhere because they cure and eventually eradicate communicable diseases and illnesses that are dangerous and even life threatening.

I think that Kevin Spacey is completely incorrect in the rest of his stance though. Vaccines are not causing us more illnesses but in fact are preventing us from obtaining illnesses. I also do not believe that vaccines are a crime against humanity but are something that we should be grateful for because they benefit us immensely.

Immigrants can bring a lot to the United States that is beneficial, such as different view points, cultural practices, languages, and rich customs that others may enjoy. However, the laws that are in place for the immigration of people should be followed because they are there for a reason- monitoring who is coming in and out of the country is in place for safety reasons as well as population control and economic stability. Immigrants I do not think take jobs away from American citizens because of the fact that many of them apply and get jobs that are mostly for the unskilled which many Americans do not want anyways. Jobs such as construction worker, burger flipper, or others that are low-status are not jobs that Americans typically strive to attain so having immigrants fill those jobs is part of what keeps America up and running. Further, for Americans that do want jobs such as these, there is so much turnover in those jobs that it really shouldn't be much of a problem finding one."

These are simply my own opinions though and have little weight in the case of others deciding what is best for them. If a woman knows she will not be able to care for a child, does not want a child, and cannot fathom giving a baby away, perhaps abortion is the best choice for her and her unborn fetus."	"Abortion should be the choice of the parents, in my opinion. I would rather have a couple, or single woman, have an abortion than have another child born that will not be taken care of properly or abused because they were not wanted in the first place. People know what they can and cannot handle and how far they will be able to stretch their resources- such as money- on another person, baby or not, and if they know that they do not have the resources or energy for a child (or another child) they should be able to make that decision without being judged for it. With that said, I think that abortion should be completed before a certain gestation week as is commonly the practice in most states because after the baby is basically fully formed it is really cruel to abort it.

I think one thing that the pro-life community that Nicolas Cage is part of does not care about is what happens to the babies after they are born.

It is simply Cruise reiterating what the US Supreme Court decided and a statement that it should be available. Because there is no argument made here I do not find the argument convincing. Merely stating something as so does not constitute an argument for his position. He would need to state why what the court decided is part of constitutional rights.

The fact that only a small portion of children vaccinated develop autism shows me that the vaccination is not the major problem but that there is some sort of other outlier.

"Since Jenner developed a chicken pox vaccine from the lesser cow pox vaccines have saved lives. Many diseases that once disfigured, hindered or killed people have been reduced to almost nothing.

His logic is based on something a conspiracy theorist would say to incite panic in the public.

Vaccinations have been around to eliminate most of the worst diseases that were common at the time without introducing more deadly ones through mutation or evolution which gives his argument little credibility.	"The medical authorities keep lying. Vaccination has been a disaster on the immune system. It actually causes a lot of illnesses. We are actually changing our genetic code through vaccination... 100 years from now we will know that the biggest crime against humanity was vaccines."	1	expert/disagree	7	1	3	2	1	1	Because this has been in the news so much I know that immigrants contribute to the GDP and more often than not pay taxes without receiving a refund. I can also state with confidence that since the industrial revolution it has been machines that replace people in companies. Immigrants contribute to the best parts of America and only add to the best parts that were already there.	Immigrants increase the GDP of our country and often find employment in the positions that most Americans would never do. Not only are they good for the economy the crime levels they bring is almost non existent compared to the domestic crime rate. Along with the added work force they bring most legal immigrants have higher education which allow us to fill positions that make us more competitive in the world furthering America's standing in the world.	1	1	1	1	3	1	1	1	1	1	Dr. Michael Barnes	like	NA	NA	6	6	Micheal believes that immigrants are responsible for taking american jobs and wants to give the jobs they take to Americans. His argument is only viable on an emotional level as it has been proven that machines have replaced american jobs and that immigrants are normally placed in positions American workers have rejected. It is much the same as China stealing American jobs where the average wage is 17 yuan which is 3 dollars an hour which no american is willing to work for. His argument is one made by many people over the centuries and that is that the outsider is the reason you are having problems now which I always found as a scapegoat reason for people who have no intelligent way of dealing with our problems.	"It is time to stand strong for the American people. After years of mass immigration, falling wages, and surging joblessness, isn't it time we focused on the needs of the people that were born here? Isn't it time we got our own people back to work?"	1	like/disagree	7	1	4	2	1	1	"I am more for abortion than I am against mainly because as a man I don't think it's my decision. In many cases abortion should be allowed without any interference such as in rape, earlier than third trimester abortion, health issues, development issues with the child or age of the women. My main opinion of abortion hinges on the basic freedom a person has and telling a women she no longer has the right to abortion is something I feel is not in step with our ideals of freedom."	America is supposed to be the land of the free but when you begin to take away rights you have to change your motto. A women has to make the choice on child birth which is difficult to any women but somehow we all imagine that it is a choice made causally with no emotion involved. The numerous circumstances that present themselves make this issue unmanageable with a set of rules and must be decided upon by the women herself.	1	1	1	1	2	1	2	4	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	3	1	Michael Phelps	dislike	I don't know	I think Micheal Phelps is a proven Olympic champion and seems like a decent person. To my knowledge the only scandal he has had is with a photo of him smoking marijuana which is not a big deal to me. I think Phelps is a hard worker and a good guy but other than that I really have no clue as to what kind of personality he has but he seems like a happy person that would be fun to hang out with.	5	6	Phelps believes that abortion is wrong under any circumstance and is unapologetic about his pro life stance. I'm not convinced by his argument because he omits cases of rape or instances where the mother's life is in danger. I am also not seeing him mention when life begins or the fact that he is taking rights away from the women who should make the choice which leaves me to believe he is unwilling to discuss the hard subject matter. His logic in this argument is basically based on his feelings and not on the horrid reality of abortion mixed with a little propaganda spread by anti abortionists about how tax dollars are spent.	"I'm pro-life and I don't apologize for it. I believe it is morally abhorrent to end an innocent human life, and I also believe it is morally wrong to use the tax dollars of millions of pro-life Americans to fund research that involves the destruction of human embryos."	1	dislike/agree	1	-1	1

He was a very kind hard working individual who wanted to pay taxes but couldn't. he did send money home to his mother but she was very poor and lived in a dangerous area. He came to America when he was under age, by himself. He did not know the language or anything. All he had was a desire to have a better work and the wear with all to work for it. In just a short time he learned the language and had a job. The people he was working for didnt really treat him right though. They all lived in an apartment that was very small. There was probably thirteen of them. They made my ex sleep outside on the concrete because there was no room or ed available and he was the youngest. He kept working though and dreamed of being in a better situation one day. Even though things weren't good here, they were better than in his home country. He fled there because of the poverty and violence. In America there were so many better opportunities for him. During this time he learned the skills of laying tile. I met him and fell instantly in love with him. We were together for three years. I would have married him but with no id he could not get married. He could not get an id because he was illegal. People always said he was with me for a green card but that is not even how green cards work. So I will tell you during this time I met some of the nice people who happened to be illegal immigrants I have ever met. They were not criminal only seeking a better life. It is sad that it is almost acceptable to be racist towards these fine people. I think however there can be a criminal element but in my opinion it isnt the norm."	The United States needs to adopt an immigration system that serves the national interest. Right now we have a President who is basically racist and against Hispanic people which clouds the issue for many people in the US. President Trump is committed to constructing a border wall and ensuring the swift removal of unlawful entrants. Now all the rednecks can holler build a wall and we can become more divided than ever. Great.	2	2	1	2	1	2	1	2	2	2	Dr. Michael Barnes	dislike	NA	NA	5	5	"I think I know who this guy is now. I think he suffered a heart attack while he was trying to obtain illegal immigrants at the border.

It is important that we are able to voice how we feel without being shut up by the people of the United States. This is one of our basic rites."	"It is time to stand strong for the American people.

I was 18 years old and in college. I had dated a boy who was bad for me for a long time. I dont think he ever really cared for me. Right when I found out I was pregnant he actually took my car and left with it. This was very sad for me. I also didnt have any money or family support because my baby was going to be mixed and I live in the south so my family is very against that and racist. They decided to shun me when they found out I was pregnant. I was very sad and had none to turn to. My family kind of manipulated me and let me know they would only speak to me if I had the abortion. I wish I could say that I forsook my family and chose my baby over my family but I was not strong enough. I ended up falling for the and had the abortion thinking my life would be better. I remember they day like it was a horror show. My real father who I hadn't seen in years showed up, which was weird. I wish they could have just been there for me and supported my dream. i remember people were outside protesting abortion which made me feel like a complete sinner. I had grown p in the church so this was very bad for me. I remember they asked me if I really wanted to do this and if I was being forced. I wanted to say yes and yes but I said no and no. TO this day i honestly want to die every day because part of me died that day. I wish young women knew the consequences that come with abortion that nobody talks about . This is why I say it needs to be illegal because if it was then I would never have been in this situation and I would have a baby, i think maybe iin the case of a rape it should be allowed."	"The pro-choice and pro-life labels are conviluded for a reason: They force people into just two boxes for all their religious, moral, political, and practical beliefs on abortion. Thats why I say, for em personally, I always wished that abortion was illegal because then I would never have been forced into having one. I could see how it would be right for other women if they werent in my situation though. It is basically just alot of labels though at the end of the day.

He may be controversial but when did the world become such babies. I remember watching Pulp Fiction when I was younger. I didnt really understand it but I knew I was watching something special. As I grew older I realized what a good movie it was and it became one of my favorites. I love the way they tell the story backwards. It will always remain a classic to me. I began wanting to watch all of his movies and I am pretty sure that I have at this point. I really loved all the Kill Bills. It is so cool that he has a woman in it that is such a bad ass. I love how he uses some of the same actors again and again. It shows that he has a good relationship with them and I think that is amazing. I honestly loved loved loved Django. I know that was a controversial movie because of the use of the n word, which he uses in his movies but you know what...he is just saying what the characters would say in real life. I dont believe he is being racist by doing that. I think he is being real. All of the black people I know really loved that movie and it was a very anti slavery movie so I love it and think he was a genius for making it. I wish Hollywood would take his lead and stop being babies and making this dumb super hero crap type movies which just caters to their already big fan base. All of these brainless popcorn movies. I know Quentin has had some scandals but I dont pay attention to those. He will forever be a genius to me."	6	5	"Mr. Tarantino has become the subject of harsh criticism from conservative Christians and even me about basically defending abortion.

The other part is when they don't protect their child and let them out in public they are endangering the health and life of other people. I find his comments very clear and straight to the point	"People think vaccines cause autism, among other things. This is not true.

With out immigration the rail roads and cities of the US would have not been built. We have to prevent illegal immigration that takes away from the legal immigrant and the citizen alike.

I don't know if these thing are true if they would keep me far away from him.	2	2	In my opinion parts of Mr. Spacey's opinion is factual in my opinion and convincing. It is very convincing that we must look out for Americans. The people of America have opened their arms to many people from around the world and maybe it is time we help the American worker who has struggled for many years to have the American Dream again. That is very convincing. I am not convinced you can blame all of America's economic problems on immigrants.	"It is time to stand strong for the American people.

I also think, that like gay marriage, all states should have the same rules. It's insane that something is legal in one state but not another! (The same notion applies to legalization of marijuana, in my opinion.) I also believe that for all the crazy protesting Christians do (and I am one), they fail to realize that NOTHING can thwart God's will and that is he wants a baby to be born, it will, and if he doesn't want a baby to be born, it won't. I don't think abortions SHOULD be allowed, and I am going to indicate that in my answer below, but I think that they WILL be allowed, and we should all deal with that and stop bickering about it."

We need to just let nature take its course.	Climate change is not something that is caused by human interaction. It's not something that is a serious threat. I think it's vastly exaggerated and just a natural cycle the Earth is going through. There's nothing we can do as humans to stop any type of climate change.	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	5	4	4	4	Ariana Grande	dislike	No	I personally don't like Ariana Grande. She has done things in the past that were disrespectful. She has even disrespected the American flag in public. I'm a US military veteran so I would never be friends with her. I think she is a bad role model for many young kids.	5	5	"I agree with Ariana Grande in that climate change is a natural phenomenon. I'm not a huge fan of her other stances, but this one I do agree with. I think the Earth goes through natural cycles in which the climate either heats up or gets colder. I don't think it's caused by human interaction. She has a good stance on this issue and one that I can side with her on."	"Climate change is a natural phenomenon. Carbon dioxide is not a pollutant. On the contrary, it makes crops and forests grow faster. Economic analysis has demonstrated that more CO2 and a warmer climate will raise the gross national product and therefore the average income."	6	dislike/agree	7	1	3	2	1	1	I think vaccination is very important to keeping a healthy population. There has been no concrete evidence linking vaccinations to issues like autism. This is an issue that I feel is definitely exaggerated. Vaccines help to save the lives of thousands of people every single day.	Vaccines are very important to helping to protect the population and save lives. There is no evidence that suggests vaccines cause illnesses and diseases such as autism. People should be required to get their children vaccinated as the ones who aren't are a danger to society.	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	Ben Roethlisberger	dislike	No	I am not a big fan of Ben Roethlisberger. He's a immoral person who has had women come out stating he raped them. I think he is a bad person and deserves to be removed from the NFL. A more thorough investigation needs to be done with the people that came out stating he raped them.	5	5	I don't agree with his statement. He is trying to say vaccines cause issues with our immune systems and cause a lot of illnesses. He has no scientific evidence to back up this statement. I think he needs to check himself and figure out what message he is trying to convey. I highly doubt in a 100 years that the biggest crime to humanity would be vaccines. They save many lives each year.	"The medical authorities keep lying. Vaccination has been a disaster on the immune system. It actually causes a lot of illnesses. We are actually changing our genetic code through vaccination... 100 years from now we will know that the biggest crime against humanity was vaccines."	2	dislike/disagree	7	1	1	6	6	6	Immigration is not good for our country. It's very bad for our economy as immigrants are taking many jobs away from US citizens. I think the country needs to crack down on immigration and restrict how many we let into our borders each year. I am all for more stringent processes for immigrants.	Immigration is not good for our country. Immigrants take away jobs from US citizens which is very bad for our economy. We need to focus on ourselves before we try to cater to those born outside of our borders. I think stricter laws need to be enacted to restrict immigration.	4	4	5	4	4	4	5	4	5	5	Dr. Michael Barnes	expert	NA	NA	5	5	"I don't agree with Michael Barnes position on immigration. Immigration takes jobs away from American citizens. Ultimately, this hurts the US economy. His evidence isn't very strong to support his position. Immigration needs to be strictly regulated and we as a nation need to help protect our borders. Immigration is something I stand strongly against."	"Immigrants expand the U.S. economy's productive capacity, stimulate investment, and promote specialization that in the long run boosts productivity. There is no evidence that these effects take place at the expense of jobs for workers that are born here."	2	expert/disagree	1	-1	4	7	7	7	Abortion is one of the issues I stand the most strongly against. I feel it should be illegal in all circumstances. Abortion is legalized murder and every child that is aborted should have the right to live. I think abortion is completely immoral. It should be banned in our country.	Abortions should be illegal in all shapes and forms. I think it is disgusting to have the ability to take away a human life before it is even born. I hope we will one day pass legislation that makes abortion completely illegal. Every child should have a chance to life.	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	Anne Hathaway	like	Yes	"I like Anne Hathaway. I think she is a great actress and I love the movies that she is in. With regard to her political stance on issues, I have no idea what she stands for. I think I would be friends with her if I personally knew her. I also think she is attractive."	6	6	I am not happy with Anne Hathaway's position on abortion. This actually makes me not want to be friends with her if I knew her personally. Just because the government says its legal doesn't mean it is morally right. I think abortion is murder and that the children that are aborted should be given every chance to have a life. It's not up to the mom to decide on their fate.	"Amid a nationwide attack on those who seek and provide abortions, the U.S. Supreme Court sided with the Constitution, and for that we should all be thankful.

"I think not all vaccines are the same, as I said flu shot always makes me sick and I feel I never catch the flu anyway.

We need to elect leaders that are willing to work to implement changes to environmental policies to slow further damage. We need influential people to start advocating to those in positions of authority for these changes that need to be addressed.	Climate change is serious and people need to start taking it seriously.

I believe that there needs to be a better immigration policy that the one that is now in place.

I think that climate change is human-caused and now in full force. The fact that we are seeing its effects mean that is has been happening for a long time and will be difficult to contain or reverse.

Immigration has been shown to strengthen the economy in the U.S. as they pay many many times more in taxes than they recieve in benefits. The economy would suffer devistating losses without immigrants' contributions to it. Immigrants do not take jobs from Americans, as there isn't a set amount of jobs in America to begin with; that number is in constant flux. Also, immigrants ARE "our own people"; they just happen to have originated elsewhere."	"It is time to stand strong for the American people.

I think we all need to make small adjustnts to our behavior but i do think it happening slowly. I think we have some time still.	I think climate change is happening. I do not think climate change is happening as rapidly as people claim including the experts. Alot of this is caused by infrastructure being built up attracting more heat. The result of the heat being attracted is hotter temperatures. When you multiply this on a huge scale i think it affecting our weather patterns.	1	1	3	1	1	1	1	1	5	1	1	1	Derek Jeter	dislike	No	As i am a Red Sox fan born and raised I do not like Jeter. I could never be fiends with a yankee. However I do think he is a great baseball player. One of the best to play. He is widely respected by yankee fans as well. I dont like him as a person but i love him as a player.	5	5	Like i specified before I agree with climate change in alot of ways. However i dont think that it is happening near as fast as people claim that it is. I also think that alot of this is manmade. As humans build more and more infrastructure roads and buildings. These attract heat. As they attract heat and their is more infrastructure that means the heat around them go up substantially. This is why i think that alot of this is manmade. If we limited infrastructure maybe we would help the weather.

There is no real evidence that suggests that vaccines cause autism at all. I think its important for kids to get vaccinated to protect other children from things they could catch. I do think that it would be wise not to mix vaccines together but to space them out when the kids get them.	I think vaccines are used for good. I think that kids do not need to be pumped full of vaccines especially when it happens where multiple drugs are pumped simultaneously.

This cant be good for little peoples bodys who immune systems arent near as strong as adults.

He mentions the rights of the woman but what about the reproductive rights of men? or the rights of the unborn child? it seems this only undermines the value of life even more. It also encourages unsafe sex since it promotes an idea that you can just abort the fetus if you become pregnant. It is very sick and just erodes the morals of this country even further then they already where. Murder is murder and unless the child or mother life is in danger it is wrong no matter how it is worded.

I donât feel like itâs too late to revert the damage done however. If humans could work together we could protect our environment. This would involve things like recycling and less littering. Using more environmentally friendly cars and products in general.	I believe climate change exists because of the human race. We are wreck-less and inconsiderate and I say that because of the constant littering mainly in our oceans. Not everyone recycles and so many of our products are not environmentally friendly.

Vaccines have been known to cause conditions like autism. The flu vaccine actually puts the virus into your body.

"People who are against abortion generally wouldn't have one anyone (men) or wouldn't know who has had one (everyone else). Taking away abortion rights doesn't actually help anyone, and it doesn't make those against abortion any more moral than anyone else. The theory that birth control will prevent it is flawed, because birth control only "controls" how often you get pregnant, and is not a complete fix. Saying that you shouldn't have sex if you don't want to be pregnant is stupid, because those very people aren't restricting their own sexuality.

It's not necessarily beneficial to deter others from having it. It's more like having control over someone else in a way that is not his right. (I don't actually believe he said this, by the way.)"

This push was a failure and now the same group of politicians is making another push for it on the backs of a new voting group that has come of age. These people don't remember the previous push and they're naive and easily convinced of pretty much anything. Keep in mind that politicians are without a doubt the least trustworthy people on the planet and are 99.9% likely to push a policy purely to serve their agenda which is likely funded by corporations and large private donations. So, is climate change real? Yes and it can be proven through the study of Earth's geological history. Is it occurring rapidly right now caused by Humans? That is highly subjective as I, personally, can witness no changes (even minute) and there is no data to back up such a claim. All I see in the media are claims that intentionally omit evidence to support the claim almost certainly because it's subjective. Computer simulation results are not sufficient to make wide ranging, overarching economic and social changes because these can be easily manipulated to generate any result you want. Is increased temperature causing a rise in sea levels? Doesn't appear to be the case from my position where the water level on the beaches still appears to be exactly where it was the many years before now."	"Again. Climate change is a proven scientific fact as it is readily observable though Earth's geological history. However, their is no reliable scientific data that demonstrates humans are responsible or that it's happening at a faster pace than previously. Computer simulated results are not acceptable. Observation indicates no change; continuation of previous cycles. It's a political ploy for which the reason I'm not sure.

I think it's just easy to wait until an earthquake or hurricane or devastating fire occurs and then say "Hey this is climate change!" I believe this subject to purely politically motivated and this person is simply the means to the end. Politicians can, for example, fund this person's research in exchange for the "scientific results" they want. Remember that consensus is actually not the driving factor in science. It is very easy to drive consensus and this has been proven by submitting peer-reviewed articles that align with liberal beliefs. Said papers are instead factual garbage yet receive praise because they align with certain agendas. Also keep in mind that certain promising discoveries in science have been and continue to be contested (this is the primary means of scientific discovery). We have spent a generation trying to disprove relativity, for example, even though we leverage the knowledge gained from it readily in many daily activities. So, when someone says you cannot oppose a scientific idea, that person is 100% serving an agenda as opposition of ideas is the fundamental concept of science.

That being said, I have no opinion on whether the vaccinations have harmful effects as I've seen no evidence (haven't looked) to show that they do. For vaccination on the whole, I'm actually against it. I believe that my body will survive the longest if it learns to defend itself, and it has done just that. I will not be getting an influenza shot, for example. The choice of whether or not to vaccinate should be the sole responsibility of the parents of the child or the person themselves, once they reach proper age. I am undecided about whether I would have my child vaccinated (if I had one), but I probably would as the results of my own experience here seem to be positive."	"I am indifferent on the issue of vaccination and I believe this should be a matter of personal choice.

So, I believe we should preserve legal immigration. However, we absolutely need to end or severely diminish illegal immigration. There are several reasons for this. We cannot run a welfare state, providing food stamps and healthcare, while we have an open border. It's unsustainable. In addition, if you continuously give people what they need, their desire to work will reduce dramatically. Politicians also use the statement "They do the jobs white people don't want." This couldn't be more of a lie. For example, my family worked for decades in the horticulture business and they wanted to do it. What they did not want to do was work beside someone who does not have to pay income tax (under the table). So, immigrants absolutely take resources away from Americans. Think of it this way. Food does not fall from the sky like it has been reported in the Bible. In our society, you must either work for money to buy food, get food from social programs, or acquire it through alternative means like theft. All of these outcomes are literally taking resources provided by Americans for Americans and giving them to illegal immigrants. Politicians continue to make the blanket statements that illegal immigrants don't get benefits and they don't take jobs. Therefore, they must be stealing their food because they don't get food stamps and they aren't able to work.....right? Legal immigration yes. Illegal immigration no. It's also not fair to someone that has been waiting for admission to our country when someone just runs across the border instead of going through proper channels."	"We have a massive problem with illegal immigration at the moment. Wages are down across the board for the working class, while cost of living has risen substantially. This makes living comfortably difficult and providing services and work opportunity to illegal immigrants is definitely a contributing factor to this. These people, without a doubt, put a strain on the system and we cannot have an open border for a country that provides food and housing to anyone who doesn't make enough money.

So, instead of helping them we hand them fresh needles so they can more safely continue their gradual demise. I completely agree with this position, though I still do not like this person.

That being said, I am not a complete supporter of abortion. I think it is best to not have children aborted, but I stand firm in my belief that people should have the right to choose their own course of action. Additionally, this should not be government funded. Because Americans are moderately divided on this issue, it is not fair to force someone who disagrees entirely to fund the abortion of others through their taxes. Now, I understand that some people are not completely financially secure which makes this a detriment, but liberal voters should be well aware of the "moral" issues which they like to use as often as possible. Having an abortion, in my opinion, is absolutely immoral as the child should have the right to live, especially if it can be born. That is, once the fetus has even a 50% chance of survival outside the womb, abortion should not be allowed and C section used to deliver if necessary. That is my opinion. I'm basically in the middle on this one because I believe in the right of life and the right of choice.

I feel like this is the worst form of murder because it involves the killing of innocent humans who cannot protect themselves. Usually it is an adult or almost an adult person who chooses to have relations with the opposite sex that get themselves in situations where pregnancy takes place. They as a person chose but now they are not letting the new little person choose or be given a chance at life. To me that is so unfair and selfish. I do realize some pregnancies take place from awful situations and that is is no one's fault in this case but the fetus and baby is the most innocent party of all and deserves a chance at life."	"I believe abortion is wrong and that it is murder. It involves taking a human that is living and growing in the womb to a human that is disfigured and killed and taken from the womb. There is nothing right about that. We are basically allowing women to murder innocent babies. Those babies have no say even though it is their bodies. The only people making choices are the women who find themselves pregnant. To me that is selfish. In my heart of hearts, I know most of these women regret it. I cannot imagine something growing inside of me and me making the decision to kill it because it will make my life difficult or will cause pain, etc. Abortion is murder."	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	Tim Tebow	dislike	Yes	I feel like I could be friends with Tim Tebow.

I don't see any reason why I could not be friends with him. I haven't heard of anything that would throw up red flags at me.	6	5	I like Tim Tebow as a person but I feel his position on this is not one that I find convincing at all. Abortion literally kills a human being. There is no way in the world that should be legal or available to women. So we are basically giving women the right to murder people. I don't really care which court says what. All I know is that a person was living and growing and after the abortion they were no longer living. That is a death sentence. Someone literally died. That is not something to be thankful for. I feel like even though women have abortions they know deep down in their souls that it is not right. I do not feel at all convinced on this Tim Tebow position.	"Amid a nationwide attack on those who seek and provide abortions, the U.S. Supreme Court sided with the Constitution, and for that we should all be thankful.

There is no reason to subject them to essentially a life sentence or such a life altering event if they don't wish to do so. No one should have a say in it beyond the woman herself.	Abortions should be up to the woman to decide. Why should a rape victim face a daily reminder or be forced to have the baby. There are plenty of medical reasons where a woman would want an abortion. I think they should be able to have one if they just don't want a baby.

When I was growing up it was acid rain and the coming ice age. Never happened. Climate change is a hoax to get control of people and their freedoms and money. The climate is set in place by God and always has been. There is nothing humans can do to manipulate the weather. All our fretting over supposed climate change should be put to better use on this country.	There is no such thing as climate change. The world has experienced many changes over time and it will again in the future. It is no more drastic or extreme than in other times in the past.

We've only been monitoring weather patterns for a few hundred years so to state that climate change is happening based on a few events is ridiculous. Limiting carbon pollution is a good idea but without the energy sources we have now life would be a lot more expensive and a lot less efficient."

Back then there were so few vaccinations to deal with. Now it seems like the medical community keeps adding to that list. From what I've read there are way too many dangerous ingredients in these vaccines. I do agree that some vaccines are useful and necessary but some of them are not. I think that children can be exposed to certain diseases and build their own immunity and be perfectly safe and okay. I am also uncertain as to the allegation that vaccines cause or contribute to autism. It seems that there is evidence that it might be true.	"Again, there is a lot of controversy on this subject and not enough is known about the side effects of vaccinations.

I now believe that abortion is wrong in any case. It is not up to human to judge if one lives or dies. The woman could simply have the child and then give it up for adoption if she did not want to keep the child. There is no need to kill any human or anything.	2	1	4	4	4	3	3	4	2	4	3	4	4	1	4	4	4	2	Adele	dislike	Yes	My attitude o Adele is that she is such a down to earth and happy person.

Vaccinations has proven to prevent many harmful diseases. I think a lot of the mumbo jumbo about vaccines from anti vaxers are just so off base.

He really seems opposed to them and feels they will have drastic consequences for people. He seems to feel that it may take years before people realize this alleged harm.

It certainly has me questioning why i thought she could be an inspiration to others. I feel she is saying these things because it seems to be a popular thing to do among liberals.

I think legal immigration is good for the country has helped us grow culturally and given us more skilled workers.

I think abortion should be legal in cases of rape or if there is a threat to the mother's life due to the pregnancy. I am still unsure about my opinion in cases of elective abortions.

We hear from some scientist that claim climate change is bad and some that say it is not as bad as imagined by others. Climate change does exist to a certain point. I believe some times climate change is confused with natural cycles the world has when it comes to the climate. Sometimes snow quits falling in different areas just because the seasons cycle in those areas and climate change may not be involved at all in those instances.	My opinion on climate change is based on how old I am and what I've seen throughout my life when it comes to the climate. I know when I was a child it snowed almost everyday when I was young where I grew up at but when I reached about twenty years old it pretty much quit snowing except for rare occasions. I do not believe the stopping of the snow has anything to do with climate change but rather the seasons cycling in the area of the country where the snow seemed to stop falling like it had years earlier.	1	1	3	5	1	1	1	1	4	1	1	1	Ariana Grande	like	No	I know little about her except for her political views and her stance for abortion.

If they are legal and haven't committed any crimes and have been a productive member of society, I think they could have a plan for citizenship."	3	3	4	4	3	2	3	4	4	4	Ariana Grande	expert	I don't know	"I don't really know much about Ariana Grande and her background or views. About all I know about her is that she is a successful singer, but I have never listened to her music and couldn't tell you anything that she sings. By looking at her, I would say she is Hispanic, so she probably would probably lean towards supporting immigration, and I really don't know if I would agree or disagree with her."	5	4	"Ariana Grande obviously supports immigrants and holds the position that immigrants do not take away jobs from Americans. She believes that they boost productivity and stimulate investment, and she is very clear in her quote. However, she would be more convincing if she actually cited specific examples that indicate how immigrants continue and promote specialization. It would be helpful if she could give statistics supporting her argument if she wants to be able to sway other in believing the same way she does to support immigrants."

God should be in control of life and death."	I still disagree with abortion because I believe it is murder and the Bible teaches against murder. A woman has the choice to have sex and whether or not to use birth control and should think about whether or not she possibly would ever want a child instead of deciding after she becomes pregnant that it is inconvenient for her.	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	Ben Roethlisberger	like	No	"I have lost all respect for Ben Roethlisberger, and I think he should go to jail.

I think his argument could be clearer in why he disagrees with abortion. I do find it convincing how he talks about feeling that it is wrong to use tax dollars to fund this research and I think he could use his position for good if he wanted to in order to speak out about what is essentially murdering another human being. I would like to hear him state specific examples and elaborate on whether or not he disagrees with abortion in all circumstances.	"I'm pro-life and I don't apologize for it.

I realize this would be more expensive, but if the parent or individual is willing to pay for the extra expense they should have that option. I think some of the vaccines are modified live vaccines (I'm not sure), and if they are then giving them all at once might be overwhelming for some people's/children's immune systems.

There is no doubt that vaccinations are a good thing. I do question that giving several vaccines at the same time is the best way.

Those who are against vaccines typically don't have the knowledge to make decisions like that. I think everyone should be able to make the decision for themselves.

She also seems like she would help anyone in need.	6	6	Julia believes that we are changing the make up of the body to do what we want by injecting vaccinations. Vaccinations are harmful to the body as this is an outside agent being injected. They go against what humans should do and in the future when we are gone the biggest mistake will be vaccines. People don't take how seriously this is for the body and the changes it causes.	"The medical authorities keep lying. Vaccination has been a disaster on the immune system.

There are a staggering amount of people coming into the country. Citizens of the country then take a backseat. There is so much given to someone who comes into the country. They take away jobs and prevent citizens from getting what they should.	I don't think the American citizen is taken care of as well as they should be of the number of immigrants coming into the country.

They take jobs and resources that are already scarce.	4	5	3	5	5	5	5	3	5	5	Tom Brady	dislike	No	I think he's a cheater and a sore loser.

This is really long overdue in many aspects of our lives. Immigrants are given the upper hand and more opportunity than the American. Americans are out of work due to the immigrant taking their position which is not fair and we need to change this.	"It is time to stand strong for the American people.

He doesn't think it's right that tax dollars are used to fund research that destroys human embroys. It is morally not acceptable to end a life of a fetus. There is no reason this should be done. The morals of this go against what he believes without question.	"I'm pro-life and I don't apologize for it.

Birth control is expensive and difficult to get. Young pregnant women have to deal with the pregnancy on their own and the expenses are high.

The problem lays with us as part of the system on Earth. There is no way to stop climate change without drastic changes to human ways of life.	"Climate change is real and caused by human civilization. It is not the fault of oil companies, it is not the fault of those who don't recycle, it is the fault of all of us. Fundamental changes to our way of life will be required to modify the rapid pace of climate change and humans are not yet ready to make those changes. They will not be minor changes like moving from gas engines to electric engines. They will be major changes like returning to a pre-industrialized way of life. For instance, driving an electric car is better for the environment than driving a new gas powered car. But driving an old gas powered car with an updated engine is better for the environment than a new electric powered car because the new electric powered car requires more inputs than the old gas powered car. The idea that a Tesla is good for the environment relative to a '76 Pinto that has already paid it cost to environment shows that even enlightened people are in denial."	3	1	2	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	5	Adam Sandler	like	I don't know	"In general, I have no desire to know celebrities.

No one human is above the other. Immigrants are no less likely to commit crimes or take another job than someone who lives here already.	Immigration is like the chicken and the egg . You can debate both sides for years and never really know the truth. Immigrants are human beings and as such are to be treated with respect.

We are in danger of leaving the planet uninhabitable if we do not act soon. I believe we have about 10 years to start cleaning up or we will be very sorry for the generations to come.

Aborting a fetus that can not be taken care of properly is probably a good idea. To say that the fetus should be carried to term and adopted out is a fanciful thought. It does not cover the cost of caring for the pregnant mother who needs proper care in order to produce a healthy pregnancy. It does not do anything for the fetus that is born drug addicted. People who adopt want healthy babies. Few adopt infants that are a "burden". Abortion is absolutely necessary. I see below that you have given an unfair choice. The term "prospective parents" does not sit well at all with me. The man in the situation should not have any say in abortion in either yes or no choices. It should be entirely the woman's choice. No one should force a woman to carry to term."	Abortion is a necessary evil. It prevents people from being born that cannot be cared for. If a mother wants an abortion it is her right to terminate in a way that is safe for her.

Trump keeps claiming what a great job he is doing on unemployment and that it practically does not exist anymore, and you can't have it both ways.
